# aegis

The map editor for a now shelved 3D RTS game. Written in Object Pascal with the Lazarus IDE, using OpenGL for graphics.

Also showcases some extra features supported by the game's engine that was rather unfortunatelly called io64:

* picking
* skeletal animation
* lens flare
* skyboxes
* texture compression
* pre-multiplied tileset blending
* mesh and normal calculation from a heightmap

Disclaimer: the provided binary was compiled a couple of years ago and was not scanned for malware before publishing to github. While I ran it myself to ensure that it still works on a more recent version of windows, use it at your own risk!
