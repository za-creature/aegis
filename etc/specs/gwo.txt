Chapter 1: Header Definition

Line 1: File type (must be set to GWO or GWOEXT)
Line 2: Model Name
Line 3: NumVertices - number of vertices (3D points)
Line 4: NumPolys - number of triangles
Line 5: NumTextures - number of textures

//ONLY FOR GWOEXT

Line 6: NumAnims - number of animations - must be greater than or equal 1
Line(s) 7 - (6+NumAnims): Name of animations 

Chapter 2: Texture Definition

Texture search paths:

<none> (texture comes with it's own path)
..\media\texture\ (for MODs that will be stored in usr\%MODNAME%\media\texture )
%GAMEDIR%\media\texture\ (absolute path)

Definition type:

Texture_ID texturename

Example:

1 wall.bmp
2 ..\media\texture\ground.bmp

Chapter 3: Polygon Definition

Definition type:

Polygon_num_Vertices (3 or 4) Texture_ID NormX NormY NormZ

(Vertex_1) Xcoord Ycoord Zcoord TexXcoord TexYCoord
(Vertex_2) Xcoord Ycoord Zcoord TexXcoord TexYCoord
(Vertex_3) Xcoord Ycoord Zcoord TexXcoord TexYCoord
(Vertex_4) Xcoord Ycoord Zcoord TexXcoord TexYCoord (only if Polygon_num_vertices is 4)

//Xcoord, Ycoord and Zcoord are relative; TexXcoord and TexYCoord are absolute


Lines that begin with # are considered comments and ignored by the parser
